# System-Backup-Script-Project

Project Name: System Backup Script

Project Description:
Create a bash script that automates the backup of important files and directories on a Linux system. The script should allow the user to specify which directories or files they want to backup, and where they want the backup to be saved. The script should also allow the user to set a backup schedule (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.) and automatically create backups according to that schedule.

Requirements:

The script should be able to backup files and directories specified by the user.
The script should prompt the user for the backup location and should create the backup in that location.
The script should allow the user to set a backup schedule.
The script should automatically create backups according to the schedule set by the user.
The script should be well-documented and easy to use.
Possible Features:

The script can send an email notification to the user when the backup is complete.
The script can compress the backup files to save space.
The script can encrypt the backup files for added security.
Sample Usage:

User inputs the directories or files they want to backup and the location where the backups should be saved.
User sets a backup schedule to run daily at midnight.
Script creates backups of specified directories or files every day at midnight.
This project will demonstrate your understanding of Linux commands, bash scripting, and basic automation techniques. It will also showcase your ability to document your work and make it easy for others to use. Happy coding!
